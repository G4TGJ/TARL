**G4TGJ AVR Radio Library**
 
This library is a set of source files for AVR processors that provide functionality of use in amateur radio applications, although many of the files could also be used in 
non-radio systems.

They provide CAT control, display, EEPROM, I2C, LCD, millisecond timer, morse keyer, oscillator (si5351a), pushbutton, rotary control and serial support.

They should work on most 8-bit AVR processors including the ATmega, ATtiny and tinyAVR 1-series.

See [TARL documentation](https://g4tgj.github.io/TARLdocs) for how to use the library.
